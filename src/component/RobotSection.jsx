              Collaboration makes perfect. The conversations and code reviews
              that happen in pull requests help your team share the weight of
              your work and improve the software you build.

              Take a deep breath. On GitHub, project management happens in
              issues and project boards, right alongside your code. All you have
              to do is mention a teammate to get them involved.
